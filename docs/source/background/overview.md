# Overview of the process

A las file goes through several steps, which alter its content. 
At first we have a `Raw` las file, sent to another process (`Myria3D`) that infers the probabilities of various classes.
From there, the las file is used a first time by this module to decide if the points are vegetation, unclassified or something else, and sent to an external process, a `rule-based segmentation`.
The las file is used a second time by this module to decide if the points are buildings or not. 

## schema of the overall process
The arrows represent dimensions in the las file, where they come from and where they are consumed.
