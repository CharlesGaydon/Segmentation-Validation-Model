    """Logic of building completion.

    The BuildingValidator only considered points that were 1) candidate, and 2) formed clusers of sufficient size.

    Some points were too isolated, or where not clustered, even though they might have a
    high predicted building probabiliy.
    We assume that we can trust AI probabilities (if high enough) in the neigborhood of large groups (clusters)
    of candidate points already confirmed by the BuildingValidator.

    We will update points classification based on their probability as well as their surrounding:
    - We select points that have p>=0.5 (+ a BDUni factor when applicable)
    - We perform vertical (XY) clustering of A) these points, together with B) confirmed buildings.
    - If the resulting clusters contain confirmed buildings, points with high probability are
    considered to be part of the confirmed building and their class is updated accordingly.
