## Description
### Context
The Lidar HD project ambitions to map France in 3D using 10 pulse/m² aerial Lidar. The data will be openly available, including a semantic segmentation with a minimal number of classes: ground, vegetation, buildings, vehicles, bridges, others.

A simple geometric rule-based semantic segmentation algorithm was applied on 160km² of Lidar data in three areas, to identify its buildings. An audit of the resulting classification showed a large number of false positive. A thorough inspection and labelling was performed to evaluate the quality of this classification, with an identification of its false positive and false negative. At larger scale, this kind of human inspection would be intractable, and more powerful methods are needed to validate the quality of the segmentation before its diffusion.

### Content
We develop a fusion module which augments rules-based semantic segmentation algorithms with deep learning neural network predictions and a public building vector database. The end goal is to edit the input (rules-based) classification as much as we confidently can, and to highlight remaining areas of uncertainty for a final human inspection.

- **Input**: point cloud that went through a first geometric algorithm that identified `candidates building points` based on geometric rules (e.g. plane surfaces, above 1.5m of the ground, etc.), and for which a semantic segmentation model produced a point-level probability of being a building (see [this repo](https://github.com/IGNF/lidar-deep-segmentation)) 
- **Output**: the same point cloud with a majority of groups of `candidates building points` either `confirmed` or `refuted`. The remaining groups are are labeled `unsure` for further human inspection.

Components are:

- `application.py`: Fuse together rules-based classification, deep learning building probabilities, and building database, highlighting area of uncertainty for a final human inspection.
- `optimization.py`: Multi-objective hyperparameter optimization of the decision thresholds.

### Process
    
1) Prediction of point-level probabilities for a 1km*1km point cloud (see [this repo](https://github.com/IGNF/lidar-deep-segmentation)))
2) Clustering of _candidate buildings points_ into connected components.
3) Point-level decision
    1) Decision at the point-level based on probabilities : `confirmed` if p>=`C1` /  `refuted` if (1-p)>=`R1`
    2) Identification of points that are `overlayed` by a building vector from the database.
4) Group-level decision :
    1) Confirmation: if proportion of `confirmed` points >= `C2` OR if proportion of `overlayed` points >= `O1`
    2) Refutation: if proportion of `refuted` points >= `R2` AND proportion of `overlayed` points < `O1`
    3) Uncertainty: elsewise.
5) Update of the point cloud classification

Decision thresholds `C1`, `C2`, `R1`, `R2`, `O1` are chosen via a multi-objective hyperparameter optimization that aims to maximize automation, precision, and recall of the decisions.

## How to run

### Install dependencies

```yaml
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/IGNF/lidar-prod-quality-control
cd lidar-prod-quality-control

# install conda
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual


# create conda environment (you may need to run lines manually as conda may not activate properly from bash script)
source bash/setup_environment/setup_env.sh

sudo apt-get install postgis

# activate using
conda activate lidar_prod
```

### Use module from package

If you are interested in running the module from anywhere, you can install as a package in a your virtual environment.

```bash
# activate an env matching ./bash/setup_env.sh requirements.
conda activate lidar_prod

# install the package
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/IGNF/lidar-prod-quality-control/tarball/main  # from github directly
pip install -e .  # from local sources
```

To run the module as a package, you will need:

- A source cloud point in LAS format with an additional channel containing predicted building probabilites (specified by `config.data_format.las_channel_names.ai_building_proba`).
- A yaml configuration specifying parameters. It is saved by hydra when running `python run.py`. You can edit `paths.output_dir` to customize where results will be saved.
Then run using
```bash
python -m lidar_prod.application paths.src_las=[/path/to/file.las]
```


### Optimization of decision thresholds

Run a multi-objectives hyperparameters optimization of the decision thresholds, to maximize recall and precision directly while also maximizing automation. For this, you need a set of LAS with 1) a channel with predicted building probability, 2) a classification with labels that distinguish false positive, false negative, and true positive from a rules-based building classification.

```yaml
python run.py task=optimize building_validation.optimization.todo='prepare+optimize+evaluate+update' building_validation.optimization.paths.input_las_dir=[path/to/labelled/val/dataset/] building_validation.optimization.paths.results_output_dir=[path/to/save/results] 
```

Optimized decision threshold will be pickled inside the results directory. 

To evaluate the optimized module on a test set, change input las folder, and rerun. You need to specify that no optimization is required using the `todo` params. You also need to give the path to the pickled decision trheshold.

```yaml
python run.py task=optimize building_validation.optimization.todo='prepare+evaluate+update' building_validation.optimization.paths.input_las_dir=[path/to/labelled/test/dataset/] building_validation.optimization.paths.results_output_dir=[path/to/save/results] building_validation.optimization.paths.building_validation_thresholds_pickle=[path/to/optimized_thresholds.pickle]
```
